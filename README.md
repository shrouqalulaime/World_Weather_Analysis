# World_Weather_Analysis

This project aims to develop a recommendation system for customers to plan for their vacation travel and trips. For example, based on the user's preference for weather conditions, the application would recommend which city they can travel to and provide suggestions for a hotel. Furthermore, the customer can decide which cities to visit and offer directions for the trip.
